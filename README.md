SQL


Step 1:
Analyze CSV files to identify header attributes and relational data. Use ERD(https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to create entity relationships and identify primary and foreign key attributes. Export sql code to create database and audit to ensure all constraints are accurate.

Step 2:
Using PGAdmin create sql-database and begin creating our tables using our SQL exported code. Once you run the code all tables will be created.

Step 3:
Import/Uplaod your existing CSV files which contain the data/information to your tables. Import csv files in this order: departments - titles - employees - salaries - dept_manager - dept_emp. Data must be importated in this in this specific order due to for key constraints, otherwise you will get unssesscful attempts. "department" and "titles" tables have no foreign keys therefore are the first two data sets to import. 

Step 4: 
Create tables views to quickly access employee and manager information.
